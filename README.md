# This is my first Portfolio project demonstrating the use of CSS.
## Here is will be demonstrating techniques such as : Core concepts, typography, Box Model, Selectors and Flexbox among many others.
This is my first project for my Junior WordPress developer course. I will be uploading to github some of my static projects highlighting the many skills I am learning as well as the use of Version control ( git and github).
